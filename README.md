# Google Mobile Ads Consent SDK for Xamarin Android Platform

Under the Google [EU User Consent
Policy](//google.com/about/company/consentstaging.html), you must make certain
disclosures to your users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and obtain their
consent to use cookies or other local storage, where legally required, and to
use personal data (such as AdID) to serve ads. This policy reflects the
requirements of the EU ePrivacy Directive and the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). To support publishers in meeting their duties under this
policy, Google offers [Consent SDK](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-consent-sdk-android).

The current project ports the Content SDK as a Xamarin Android library project.
